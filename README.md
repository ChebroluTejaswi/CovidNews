##### We have designed a website regarding corona cases, deaths, beds availability ets...

## Features of Website
### 1.) Contact Information
#####  -> General contact,Email,Social webpage informations are given at the first 
#####  -> If we need any specific contact information of specific State/District, it can be obtained by searching.
#####  -> In case of any Emergency information the toll-free number is provided at the bottom

### 2.) Guidelines and Advisories
#####  -> Due to covid pandemic many rules and regulations are given by the government
#####  -> Some of the important guidelines to be read for the day-to-day activities is mentioned below
#####  -> If the user wants any Specific guidelines, he/she can search for specific guideline pdf

### 3.) Hospitals and Beds available
#####  -> Total number of hospitals and the current bed avalabilty is displayed at first
#####  -> If you are in a particular state and if you want to know about the status, then you can search accordint to statewise for hospital/bed availability
#####  -> Even if we are quarantined in hospitals, We should do some daily routines to be healty. Those guidelines are given below

### 4.) Medical College availability
#####  -> Instead of self-quarantine, if a person asymptomatic Covid positive, they can be quarantined at these places
#####  -> Availablity of Each college and the beds are provided accordingly
#####  -> Guidelines to followed at the quarantine centres are given

### 5.) Deceased person graph
#####  -> If we want to know the spread of corona virus in the city, it can be known through the given grapgh
#####  -> We can directly download the graph or we can get it to our mail id

## Future Application

##### 1.) Everyone can know the live updates of corona cases and its effects from where ever they want
##### 2.) Extra features like Corona cases in citywise can be displayed in graphwise, so that person can decide about the travel to the specific city
##### 3.) By knowing the ratio of affected persons and the death warning zones can be marked so that people can take necessary steps

## Constraints

##### The website we designed has few limitations which can be updated in fothcoming updates...
##### Some of the main constraints are,
##### 1.) The website is hosted locally not globally
##### 2.) The website wont fit for all screen sizes

## Status of project
#### Task 1,2,3 has been done completely With both front end and backend
#### For task 4, If the inputs are given you will get the output graph correspondingly but it is working only in local server, as we could not deploy our python algorithm as a global host we made to work in local host.  We kept screenshots and the algorithm file (submitted in repository).
